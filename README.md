Screen Time Analysis with Python

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing user screen time data using Python. It provides insights into app usage patterns, the relationship between notifications and app engagement, and daily/weekly screen time trends. The analysis aims to help understand user behavior across various applications.

Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains the following features:

•
Date: The date on which the data was recorded.

•
App: The name of the application being used (e.g., Instagram, WhatsApp).

•
Usage (minutes): The total number of minutes spent on the app daily.

•
Notifications: The number of notifications received from the app each day.

•
Times Opened: The number of times the app was opened on the recorded day.

Note: The dataset can be downloaded from here (placeholder link, replace with actual link if available).

Analysis and Visualizations

The project includes several key analyses and visualizations:

1. Screen Time Trends for Different Apps

This analysis visualizes the screen time usage of various applications over time, highlighting fluctuating and consistent usage patterns. For example, Instagram often shows the most fluctuating and high usage.

2. Relationships between Screen Time, Notifications, and Times Opened

This section explores the correlations between app usage minutes, the number of notifications received, and how many times an app was opened. It reveals insights such as a moderate positive correlation between notifications and times opened.

3. Top Apps Based on Screen Time

An analysis of average usage, notifications, and times opened per app provides a clearer picture of user behavior. Key insights include Instagram leading in screen time and notifications, and Netflix showing high usage with low interaction frequency.

4. Average Screen Time Usage per Day of the Week

This analysis breaks down average screen time by day of the week, revealing patterns such as higher engagement during weekdays and moderate usage over the weekend.

5. Average Daily Usage for Top Apps

Detailed daily patterns for top apps like Instagram, Netflix, and WhatsApp are analyzed to understand how users engage with these apps throughout the week.

6. Probability of App Openings Through Notifications

This section calculates the probability of a user opening an app after receiving a notification. A significant finding is the high responsiveness to notifications across all analyzed apps, suggesting that notifications are highly effective in prompting user engagement.
